# Preamble - A cross-browser web extension
An extension for having a pleasant sight-seeing experience before embarking on your browsing journeys.

## The goal
This was meant as an attempt to clone the Momentum extension, and see how far I could get by just using free API's.

Quotes: [They Said So](https://theysaidso.com)  

## Disclaimer
Since this project was both for practice and for filling a very specific *UI quirk* need, the main purpose of the app is achieved. 
A clock, a daily quote, the weather and the ability to change background. 

The rest of the features are in a skeleton stage. This means the settings don't do much other than being pretty, though I might add stuff every now and then.

## Thanks
Thanks to the Svelte's Discord user Corrl who shed light on how to graciously enhance the crossfading implementation.
